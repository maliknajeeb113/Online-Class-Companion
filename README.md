# Online-Class-Companion
In the wake of the pandemic, we have seen a shift that took place in the education system, where classes moved from the offline system to the online system. During online classes we all saw it was not easy to conduct and attend online classes  with the same energy and excitement constantly. So this project helps students to be more connected with the class and also make sure he/she does not miss something important, as the idea of this project is to help student record the class and take notes not only that but they can also test their grasping knowledge, and also get a constant note on the emotion that the students is going through during that class and vice versa.
